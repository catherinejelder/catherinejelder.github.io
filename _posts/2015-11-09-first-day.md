Yesterday was my first day at [The Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), a progammer's writer's retreat in NYC where I'll be working for the next 3 months. Yay! I had a few goals for my first day:  
* Start a blog - VICTORY!  
* Meet lots of people - VICTORY! Everyone is nice, and smart, and working on interesting stuff.  
* Clarify a couple goals and projects to work on - less victory. On the plus side, there are a lot of people interested in functional programming. Everyone's using Haskell! To be continued!
