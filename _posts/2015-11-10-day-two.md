Today was pretty scattered. I read a bit about [Linux](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/index.html) and [git](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out), among other topics. I looked around for Scala projects on github that looked newbie-friendly. A bit more work on my [Haskell MOOC](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+FP101x+3T2015/info).  

There's a talk tomorrow on picking a good project to work on! Is something involving Scala, music, AND my Android watch too much to hope for??

I ate my first slice of NYC pizza while trudging through the rain, and it was still a pretty good experience!
