I've been at the Recurse Center for two months now! Here are a few of the things I've worked on:

* An Android Wear Spotify client controlled by dance moves. Coming to github soon!

* A Scheme interpreter written in Python or Scala (TBD). Just started.

* Bits and pieces of MOOCs on Haskell and reactive programming

* A couple brief tech talks. I'll record them soon for youtube.

* Brushing up on my Python :snake:

* Interview prep

* A draft of an essay about computational complexity, which I'm hoping to submit to [Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/).

* This blog!

I'll be here at the Recurse Center for another two weeks, then job hunting. I'll be in NYC till at least early March. 

RC has been great, not just for the opportunities to learn technical skills, but because you can learn them in a large, supportive social network. Considering how hostile our industry can be, this feels really rare and special to me.

Thanks RC, for showing me how things could be, and making it a lot harder to go back to the way things were.
