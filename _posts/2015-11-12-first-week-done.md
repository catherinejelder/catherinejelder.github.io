A couple things today gave me warm fuzzies.  

First, we spent an hour doing a "non technical checkin". This is a weekly standup to talk about non technical issues we're facing. A meeting about feelings!

Second, we had an hour of presentations. Everyone who signed up got 5 minutes to talk about their latest project. Lots of cool stuff is happening here, and I can't wait to present! Hopefully next week!
