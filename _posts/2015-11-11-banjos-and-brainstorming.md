Today I brainstormed some ideas for a music-oriented app or tool with Chip, a Recurser from the batch before me (thanks, Chip)! We came up with some cool-sounding stuff, but I was a bit discouraged thinking that all my ideas sounded pretty similar to the stuff I already know how to do (scripting and backend web development in high level languages). I'm going to spend more time tomorrow thinking about which specific skills I want to grow, and let that influence my project's direction.  

I also decided that I don't want to focus on learning new languages, not for it's own sake! As fun as it is, learning languages is something I can do alone. I need to spend RC time collaborating with my awesome colleagues, which is hard to do if I'm still in my baby talk stage. Java / Scala / maybe Python it is, for the near future!  

Then I went and saw Gillian Welch, and all was right with the world.  

My cellphone camera is not in good health, thanks to taking a tumble in Central Park, so you'll have to take my word for it when I say that the middle blob here is GILLIAN WELCH! 
:joy:

So blobby. Such talent. So banjo.
